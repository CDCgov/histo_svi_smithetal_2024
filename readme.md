## Overview

This repository houses code for analyses for a paper exploring associations between rurality, 
the Minority Health Social Vulnerability Index, and histoplasmosis incidence in eight states in the US.

All analyses were done in R 4.2.2, using `renv` for managing dependencies. 
The package dependencies are versioned in [renv.lock](renv.lock), and after 
cloning this repository and installing `renv` can be set up by running the 
following code:

```
renv::activate()
renv::restore()
```

### Data

- All data are stored in the [data/raw](data/raw) folder, but not included in this repository.
  - `data/raw/NCHS Urban_Rural Codes.xlsx`: from the [NCHS urban-rural classification scheme for 2013](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm#2013_Urban-Rural_Classification_Scheme_for_Counties)
  for the subset of states included in our dataset. Pulled from [this dataset](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/data_acces_files/NCHSURCodes2013.xlsx).
  - `data/raw/mh_svi_20230329.csv`: the [Minority Health SVI](https://www.minorityhealth.hhs.gov/minority-health-svi/) measures as well as the component 
  metrics that go into the each of the indices/themes, available at [this link](https://www.minorityhealth.hhs.gov/minority-health-SVI/assets/downloads/mh_svi_county_20230329.csv).
  - `HistoSVI.xlsx`: the histoplasmosis case counts by county and year. This only includes
  counties and years with any cases of histoplasmosis. This data was from an enhanced surveillance project (2011 - 2014), 
  shared with CDC MDB by state partners, or from NNDSS (2020), available with permissions from each state partner. 

### Analyses
- The analyses are run using the scripts in the [analysis](analysis) folder in the 
following order:
  - [01_get_regional_mhsvi.R](analysis/01_get_regional_mhsvi.R): pulls in raw data sources for the MH SVI 
  and the NCHS urban-rural classification scheme to calculate regional
  specific, and rural classification specific SVIs based on code from  (Sarah Rockhill)[https://github.com/s5rockhill/mh-svi].
  - [02_clean_histo_data.R](analysis/02_clean_histo_data.R): takes the regional and stratified svi's and joins them 
  with county level histoplasmosis case count and population data across the six
  years included in the study (2011 - 2014, 2019, 2020). Population data were accessed from 
  US census data using the [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/index.html) package.
  - [03_run_models.R](analysis/03_run_models.R): using the cleaned histo data, aggregates to the sum of population
  and histo cases across the six years. Runs a truncated poisson hurdle models 
  on this aggregated cases counts using the R package 
  [glmmTMB](https://glmmtmb.github.io/glmmTMB/index.html), both for regional and a stratified analysis by rurality. Uses the R package
  [DHARMa](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DHARMa/index.html) to run diagnostics on simulated model residuals.
  - [04_make_figures.R](analysis/04_make_figures.R): takes output from previous steps and create main and 
  supplementary figures, as well as summary statistics for Table 1. 
  
### Outputs
- Outputs from the first two steps of the analysis are saved to the `data` folder, 
but are not included in this repository due to restrictions on sharing. 
- The outputs from the other steps of the analyses are included in this repository in the [output/](output)
folder, except for the full hurdle model output (which includes the original data set). 
- Figures are included in the [figs/](figs) folder. 
- [methods_results_supp.qmd](methods_results_supp.qmd) includes some results, methods, and supplementary text that is pulled in to the initial draft of the main manuscript (although wording may have been revised.)
